1.a) The minimum cost to reach (m, n) from (0,0) is (m+n)+((m(m-1))/2).
One path with minimum cost would be moving n steps up then m steps right. This is unique as you must take the upward steps first as they are the cheapest before moving right.
b) i) False, because moving right will always eventually be cheaper than continuing upwards.
ii) False, moving upwards will be cheaper than moving right, so y will exceed n before we reach m.
iii) True, because UCS uses a priority queue to only explore the cheapest actions.
c) i) True, the minimum distance path cost will remain or decrease if the new connection is cheaper.
ii) True, the changed edge could be negative enough to offset an expensive surrounding path and become the new minimum path.
iii) False, because a longer path with actions that cost 0 could become more expensive than a shorter path. 

2.b) This path from AOERC to the Oval assumes no foot traffic but it goes in busy areas such as building which are likely to be congested.
Our model does not account for this. I learned this is the closest parking to the Oval. This surprised me as there
is parking directly left of the oval, but it isn't the shortest path.

3.b) The maximum number of states visited for n locations with k waypoints is n * 2^k. We can visit each location
with 2 ^ k different possibilities of tags collected.
c) I made a route from the oval to AOERC with waypoints for food and parking. I learned my 
endpoint is the best point to park if I plan to get food before going to AOERC after starting my day at the oval.
I would consider bringing a skateboard since this looks like a long route. I expected
it to take a long route since the oval and AOERC are on opposite sides of campus.

4.d) To have the same time complexity for A* with no waypoints heuristic and the relaxed shortest
path problem, we would need the waypoints to lie on the diagonal toward 9,9.
For example, (1,1), (2,2), ..., (9,9).
