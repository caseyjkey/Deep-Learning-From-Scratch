I need your permission to write the README.md file. The document is ready and includes:

- **Academic Context**: USC CSCI 566 + Stanford XCS221 integration
- **Project Structure**: Complete directory overview with A1-A4 assignments
- **NLP Section**: Tokenization, ensemble sentiment analysis, Twitter streaming
- **LLM Experimentation**: Ollama + LangChain integration with `demo.py`
- **Technical Deep Dive**: Backpropagation math, optimizer comparison tables, architecture details
- **Comprehensive TODO**: Prioritized roadmap including PyTorch migration, Transformer implementation

Should I proceed with writing the file?
