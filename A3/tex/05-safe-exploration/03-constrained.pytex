\item \points{5c}

Consider a different way of setting the constraint where you limit the set of actions the agent can take in the action space. 
In ConstrainedQLearning, implement constraints on the set of actions the agent can take each step such that \texttt{velocity\_(t+1) < velocity\_threshold}. 
Remember to handle the case where the set of valid actions is empty. Below is the equation for calculating the velocity at time step t+1. 
$$\text{velocity}_{t+1} = \text{velocity}_t + (\text{action} - 1) * \text{force} - \cos(3 * \text{position}_t) * \text{gravity}$$
We've determined that in the mountain car environment, a velocity of 0.065 is considered unsafe. After implementing the velocity constraint,
run grader test 5c-0-helper to examine the optimal policy for two continuous MDPs running Q-Learning (one with max\_speed of 0.065 and the other with a very large max\_speed constraint).
Provide 1-2 sentences explaining why the output policies are now different. 

\textbf{What we expect:} Complete the implmentation of \texttt{ConstrainedQLearning} in \texttt{submission.py}, then run \texttt{python grader.py 5c-0-helper}. Include 1-2 sentences explaining why there is a difference between the two scenarios.
